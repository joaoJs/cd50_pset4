1.  What’s stdint.h?

        stdint.h is a header file from the C standard library. It declares sets of integer types having specified widths, 
        and the corresponding sets of macros;
        
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    
        They are minimum width integer types. They ensure that unsigned integer types with lesser size have at least N bytes width.
        
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

        BYTE = 1; DWORD = 4; LONG = 4; WORD = 2;
        
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    
        in hexadecimal = 0x424d;
        
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

        biSize is the size of the image and bfSize is the size of the whole bitmap file, including the headers. 

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

         If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (Device Independent Bitmap) with the origin at the upper left corner.
        
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

        biBitCount;
        
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

        If you don't have permission to open the file, or the file doesn't exist.

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

        This one is the arguments passed in as the blocks parameter. The blocks parameter tells the function the number of elements. 
        to read. In copy.c we're just reading one element at a time. First we read BITMAPFILEHEADER, then BITMAPINFOHEADER and then RGBTRIPLE. 

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

        (4 - ( 3 * 3 ) % 4) % 4;
        (4 - 9 % 4) % 4;
        (4 - 1) % 4;
        3 % 4;
    ==> 3;
        
11. What does fseek do?

        It changes the offset of the file pointer.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?

        Seek from current location/position in file. Can be used as third argument of fseek() function.
